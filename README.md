Toy OS for learning purposes. Named after 
[Newton da Costa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_da_Costa).

# Running

You need a Linux machine with `nasm`, `qemu` and `make` installed.

Clone the repository and `cd` to the project directory.

Then run:

    $ make

For now you should see a message from our kernel.
